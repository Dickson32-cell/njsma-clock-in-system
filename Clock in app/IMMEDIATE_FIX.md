# IMMEDIATE FIX: Update Render Build Commands

## 🚨 Quick Fix for Your Current Error

Your files are in a subdirectory called "Clock in app" in your GitHub repository. Instead of moving files, let's update your Render settings to look in the correct folder.

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Go to Your Render Service
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your web service (`clock-in-system`)
3. Click on the "Settings" tab

### Step 2: Update Build Command
1. Find the "Build & Deploy" section
2. In the **Build Command** field, change from:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   To:
   ```
   cd "Clock in app" && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 3: Update Start Command
1. In the **Start Command** field, change from:
   ```
   gunicorn app:app
   ```
   To:
   ```
   cd "Clock in app" && gunicorn app:app
   ```

### Step 4: Save and Deploy
1. Click "Save Changes"
2. Go to the "Deploys" tab
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

## 📋 Expected Settings After Fix

Your Render service settings should look like this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Build & Deploy Settings                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Environment: Python 3                                      │
│                                                             │
│ Build Command:                                              │
│ cd "Clock in app" && pip install -r requirements.txt      │
│                                                             │
│ Start Command:                                              │
│ cd "Clock in app" && gunicorn app:app                     │
│                                                             │
│ Auto-Deploy: Yes                                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎯 What This Does

- `cd "Clock in app"` - Changes to your project directory
- `&&` - Runs the next command only if the first succeeds
- The rest runs your normal build/start commands from the correct folder

## ✅ Expected Success Output

After making these changes, you should see:

```
==> Running build command 'cd "Clock in app" && pip install -r requirements.txt'...
==> Installing Python version 3.9.18...
Successfully installed Flask-2.3.3 Flask-SQLAlchemy-3.0.5 Werkzeug-2.3.7 ...
==> Build successful! 🎉
==> Starting service with 'cd "Clock in app" && gunicorn app:app'
```

## 🚀 Alternative: Fix Python Version

I also notice your build is using Python 3.13.4 instead of 3.9.18. If you want to fix this too:

1. In your GitHub repository, make sure `runtime.txt` contains exactly:
   ```
   python-3.9.18
   ```

2. Or accept Python 3.13.4 by updating your local `runtime.txt` to:
   ```
   python-3.13.4
   ```

## 📞 Need Help?

If you can't find the Settings tab:
1. Make sure you're looking at your **Web Service** (not the database)
2. The service should be named `clock-in-system`
3. Look for tabs: Overview, Logs, **Settings**, Environment, etc.

Try this fix and let me know if you need help finding the settings!
